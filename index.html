<body>
 <h3>Hello! My name is Stephen Lee and welcome to my website.</h3>
 <p>I am a recent graduate from <span style= "color: purple;">San Francisco State University</span> where I majored in Business Administration- Information Systems.</p>
 
 <p>
 I worked as a Quality Assurance Intern at State Compensation Insurance Fund during the summer of 2019, where I wrote, conducted, and maintained test scripts and cases
  for functional and other testing. I most recently interned at SSF Imported Auto Parts with the sales administrative team, where I generated leads and directed my finidngs to the sales team.
  I utilized the company database, IBM AS/400, to search client information and fulfill product orders for welcome and promotional kits.
 </p>
 
 <p>I have various hobbies. I am an avid basketball🏀 and football🏈 fan, but primarily basketball. The <span style= "color: blue;">Golden State Warriors</span> and <span style= "color: red;">San
  Francisco 49ers</span> are my<br>
  favorite teams since they are my local teams. Along with being a sports fan, I collect vintage clothing👕 and sneakers👟. That passion has turned into a part-time hobby, where I sell
  my personal collection and other pieces. I also like watching Anime on my free time as well. 
 </p>
