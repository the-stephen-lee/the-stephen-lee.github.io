 <h3>Hello! My name is Stephen Lee and welcome to my website.</h3>
 <p>I am curently a fourth year student at <span style= "color: purple;">San Francisco State University</span> and I am majoring in Business Administration- Information Systems.</p>
 
 <p>
 I worked as a Quality Assurance Intern at State Compensation Insurance Fund during the summer of 2019, where I wrote, derived, and maintained test scripts and cases
  for functional and other testing. I now intern at SSF Imported Auto Parts with the sales administrative team, where I conduct research on a
 list of given leads then determine which companies are qualified to be customers.
 </p>
 
 <p>I have various hobbies. I am an avid basketball🏀 and football🏈 fan, but primarily basketball. The <span style= "color: blue;">Golden State Warriors</span> and <span style= "color: red;">San
  Francisco 49ers</span> are my<br>
  favorite teams since they are the local teams. Along with being a sports fan, I collect vintage clothing👕 and sneakers👟. And I like watching
  Anime on my free time as well. </p>
  
 <p>Here is my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> and my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-lee-822178174/">Linkedin</a>
  account if I pique your interest.</p>
